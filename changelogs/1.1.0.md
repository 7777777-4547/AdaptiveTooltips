- Updated to 1.19.3

## New settings

- **Overwrite vanilla wrapping** - stops tooltips from wrapping themselves to 170px in guis and instead wraps using AT.
- **YACL-style tooltip position** - use positioning from YetAnotherConfigLib for button widgets
- **Remove first line padding** - removes the extra 2px given to the first line's height
- **Prevent vanilla clamping** - starting 1.19.3, vanilla prevents overflowing tooltips to the left by overflowing to the right, this prevents that as it conflicts with certain positioning tweaks present in AT
- **Only reposition hover tooltip** - starting 1.19.3, there are multiple positioners present other than the normal hovering one, AT tweaks are only designed for hover tooltips, so disabling this may cause unexpected behaviour

## Wrapping Changes

- Only allow Remaining width wrapping open with hover positioners

### New methods

- **Half screen width** - wraps tooltips with the maximum line width of half the screen width
- **Smart** - Wraps lines that are considerably longer than the others, with a hard limit of 3/4 of the screen width.

## Misc

- Rewrote internal positioning management to be more modular
- Add wrapping hooks for more tooltip rendering functions
- Give a description to each of the wrapping options in the GUI
